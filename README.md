End-to-end read quality control and trimming pipeline. Optional preflight gate (sub-skill: preflight/sequali-input-preflight) validates raw reads (file presence, md5 if provided, paired-end parity, platform detection) before QC raw reads (sequali + multiqc), identify issues, trim/clean (fastp/fastplong/trim_galore), then QC trimmed reads to verify. Sandwich pattern: Preflight → QC → Trim → QC → Go/No-Go.

## 🚀 Installation

This is an **agent skill**, not a user-facing library. The recommended install path is to let your AI agent import it.

**Option A — give your agent this prompt (recommended):**

```text
Install the read-qc-trimming skill from
https://github.com/cheahhl814/read-qc-trimming —
clone it into your agent's skills directory (the path your agent watches
for skills) and run `pixi install` from that directory. Then read the
skill's SKILL.md to understand its phases and the Input/Output contract
for each. Confirm when the environment is ready.
```

**Option B — manual install:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cheahhl814/read-qc-trimming.git
cd read-qc-trimming
pixi install
```

> [!TIP]
> `pixi install` resolves every pinned tool from `pixi.toml` (channels: conda-forge, bioconda) into an isolated `.pixi/` environment — no system-wide installs, no version conflicts with other skills.

## 💡 Usage

The skill is designed to be driven by an AI agent: the agent reads the master `SKILL.md`, detects the current phase from the filesystem state of your run directory, and routes to the right sub-skill.

### Natural-language prompts that trigger the skill

```text
quality control reads
trim reads
QC fastq
clean raw reads
sequali
```

### Manual phase execution

If you prefer to drive the phases yourself (or want to re-run a single phase):

```bash
# Set your run directory (all phase artifacts land here)
RUN_DIR=/path/to/run-dir

pixi run preflight   # Phase 1 — validate inputs, write preflight.md + params.json
pixi run run         # Phase 2 — execute the workflow (after preflight ≥ GO)
pixi run qc          # Phase 3 — build the final report (after run completes)
pixi run debug       # On failure — interpret stderr via the signature library
pixi run battle-test # Verify the skill's structural integrity
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each phase has an explicit **Inputs/Outputs contract** at the top of its sub-skill `SKILL.md`. If the upstream artifact is missing (e.g. you run `run` before `preflight` passed), the sub-skill refuses to proceed and tells you which phase to run first. Phases are gated on purpose — don't skip them.

## 🔬 Pipeline overview

The analysis follows a phased evidence chain. Each phase consumes the artifacts of the previous phase and gates progression with a Go/No-Go check.

| # | Phase | Goal | Sub-skill | Artifact produced |
|:--|:------|:-----|:----------|:------------------|
| **1** | **Preflight** | **v1.0.0 (new).** Pre-flight gate for the read-qc-trimming pipeline. Mirrors the `bettamt-preflight` pattern from [Betta | `preflight/` | `$RUN_DIR/preflight.md` |

> [!TIP]
> Read each sub-skill's `SKILL.md` for the full procedure, its ask-user stop points, and its signature library (stderr pattern → cause → fix).

## 🧰 Tools

All tools are resolved from conda-forge/bioconda via the pinned `pixi.toml`.

| Tool | Version | Role |
|:-----|:--------|:-----|
| `------` | --------- | ---------- |
| `sequali` | QC metric generation | All platforms (short + long reads) |
| `multiqc` | Aggregate QC reporting | All platforms |
| `fastp` | Trimming & cleaning | Short reads (Illumina) |
| `fastplong` | Trimming & cleaning | Long reads (ONT, PacBio) |
| `trim_galore` | High-stringency adapter removal | Short reads (when fastp fails) |
| `seqkit` | **Preflight only** — paired-end read counting + average read length for platform detection | All platforms |

Tool usage is grounded in the offline `docs-corpus/` snapshots (version-matched `--help`/`man` captures, upstream repo docs, and web docs as fallback) — the agent reads these instead of guessing flags.

## 🔄 Update check

Every skill built with [bioinfo-skill-creator](https://github.com/cheahhl814/bioinfo-skill-creator) ships a self-update check that compares the deployed git SHA against this upstream repo via `git fetch` — no GitHub API call, no extra dependencies.

```bash
pixi run update-check
```

| Verdict | Exit | Meaning |
|:--------|:-----|:--------|
| `UP-TO-DATE` | 0 | Local HEAD matches origin/HEAD |
| `LOCAL-AHEAD` | 0 | Unpushed local commits; no action needed |
| `BEHIND-BY-N` | 1 | Upstream is N commits ahead → re-pull/re-sync from this repo |
| `OFFLINE` | 2 | `git fetch` failed; informational only |
| `NO-ORIGIN` | 2 | No `origin` remote configured; informational only |

## 🔒 Hard guarantees

- **Filesystem evidence chain** — every phase emits the artifact the next phase consumes; the boundary between phases is the filesystem, not agent memory.
- **Docs-grounded tool usage** — tool flags come from `docs-corpus/`, never from the agent's memory.
- **Explicit stop points** — ambiguous decisions are surfaced to you as *Evidence + Recommend + Options*, not auto-picked.
- **Reproducible environments** — every tool is pinned in `pixi.toml` and resolved via pixi.

## 🚀 Nextflow runner

This skill does not currently ship a Nextflow runner. For cohort/HPC execution, wrap the `pixi run` tasks in a workflow scheduler of your choice.

## Provenance

Built with the [bioinfo-skill-creator](https://github.com/cheahhl814/bioinfo-skill-creator) meta-skill (v1.1.0), following the AiX-BIO skill convention (preflight → build → debug → battle-test evidence chain). Pattern adopted from:
